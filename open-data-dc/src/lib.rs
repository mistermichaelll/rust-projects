// the API for ArcGIS is kind of annoyingâ€“where the actual data we want is 
//  a few layers down in the "features" layer. So we create a few different structs:
//    * Feature: This struct represents individual features from the API response and contains the attributes of interest.
//    * ApiResponse: This struct represents the entire API response and is a vector (array) of Feature structs.
//    * Crashes: This struct represents the attributes related to crashes. 
//          Each attribute is annotated with serde rename attributes, which specify how the fields should be deserialized from JSON. 
//          This struct defines the data structure for the crash-related attributes within each feature.
